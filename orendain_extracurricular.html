           <b>La Joya Community High School Feminist Club	08/2016-Present</b>
            Member since August 2016. Host discussions on topics such as Gun Control, Rape, Racism, et cetera. Host a yearly event called "Stay Woke" where people have the chance to showcase issues that are relative towards them, their art, poems that they composed, music, et cetera. Have learned about other issues that don't necessarily pertain to me but are important nonetheless. Attended the Phoenix Social Justice Conference and Youth Symposium.

            <b>AETA Conference	 	09/2018-9/2018</b>
            I attended the Arizona English Teacher Association conference the 22nd of September. We, a group of high school students, presented in front of English teachers from all over the state; this gave us a chance to explain to them what English means to us and the different things that we all learned from our English classes. We also illuminated some parts of our English classes that we felt could use some revision, such as what conversations teachers should bring up in the classroom; like conversations about racism when talking about, “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn”, for instance.

            Was a technician from December 2017 to April 2018. Helped the stage manager with gathering the props and bringing them on stage, call the actors, set up lights and help with curtains, etc.
